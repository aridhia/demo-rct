# Randomized Controlled Trials
A clinical trial is a planned experiment involving humans, their aim is to assess the safety and efficacy of new approaches before utilizing them in healthcare. The mainn phases of clinical trials are:
* Phase I: Performed in a healthy population to assess safety
* Phase II: Initial safety investigation in patients
* Phase III: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the new product
* Phase IV: Post-marketing surveillance once the drug has reached the market

A **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** is the gold-standard of clinical research. Aims to reduce sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of a new product.
* When **randomizing**, each subject is randomly allocated to a group of the trial, this reduces the selection and allocation bias. There are different ways of randomizing; in a simple randomization each group assignment is independent, whereas in a restricted randomization constraints are used to achieve a specific assignment ratio. Finally, randomization helps to achieve comparability of the control and treatment groups in all characteristics, so differences in outcome can be attributed to differences in treatment and not to different characteristics of the two groups.  
* In **controlled trials**, there is one control group that is the group to whom those receiving the treatment are compared to. The control group will be given either the usual care (best current treatment) or a placebo (treatment with no active ingredient). The populations in the different gropus must be equivalent so we can compare them.

Most of the times RCT are **double-blind** studies, meaning that both the patients and the investigator are unaware of the group allocations. This method removes detection and performance bias. Contrarily, in an **open-label trial** group allocations are known by the patients and investigator.
