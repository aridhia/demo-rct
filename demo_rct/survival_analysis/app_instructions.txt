This app can be used to perform Survival Analysis.

To run the app, it is necessary to have a csv file called "survival_analysis.csv" in the same folder as the app.

The "survival_analysis.csv" file to use the app has to:
  - Contain a variable about the time object of each subject for the survival analysis
  - Contain a variable about the endpoint, coded as 1/0; being 1 if the outcome happened and 0 if it did not happen
These two variables are the ones the user will have to select in the first tab to set up the analysis.

The "survival_analysis.csv" should also contain other covariates interesting to the model or to generate the characteristics table.

As the app reads the .csv columns directly it is not necessary to edit any part of the code.
